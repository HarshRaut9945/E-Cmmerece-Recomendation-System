🛒 E-Commerce Recommendation System using Machine Learning & NLP
📌 Project Overview

This project implements an E-commerce Product Recommendation System using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
The system analyzes user behavior and product information to provide personalized product recommendations, enhancing user experience and increasing engagement.

The recommendation engine supports content-based filtering by understanding product descriptions using NLP and similarity measures.
